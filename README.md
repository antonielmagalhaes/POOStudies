# OOP

Is a programming parading centered around objects rather than functions 

> There are several languages that supports object oriented programming


- C#
- Java
- Ruby
- Python 
- JavaScript
- ...

Object oriented programming is absolutely necessary if you want to be a seriously developer you need to understand OOP (Object-oriented Programming).

# OOP Principles

Before object-oriented programming we have procedural programming, that divide the program into a set of functions, these functions operate on the data. This part of program is very simple and straightforward. But, as your program grow the number of functions grow, and then there functions for all the place, that paradigm programming __exists a lot of interdependence of code__. Object-oriented Programming came to solve this problem, OOP combine a group of variables and functions into a unity.


__4 Pillars of Object-oriented Programming__

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Benefits of OOP

> ***Encapsulation*** = Reduce complexity + increase reusability 
>
>***Abastraction*** = Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes 
>
>***Inheritance*** = Eliminate redundant code
>
>***Polymorphism*** = Refactor ugly switch/case statements
